# Open Sea

This project is my effort to learn C++ while also improving my skills with OpenGL. The aim is to create a usable game engine supporting at least two, if possible then also three dimensions. As the purpose is to learn C++, there will be a lot of iterative improvements and often substantial changes of how the system works in order to make it better.
